# ExtractiveDocumentSummarization

This is a program to create summaries with one or more documents to understand the contents of the document before wasting time reading full pages to understanding the main point on what they are reading. An example would be for books, business papers, etc. 

In order for us to complete the program, we needed access to a Dataset that allows our model to learn the term frequency, stemming all words and tokenizing each sentence.

The GitHub link to the SUMPUBMED Dataset: https://github.com/vgupta123/sumpubmed

In order to run this program, please see the 'requirements.txt' file to understand how to execute the program.

Thank you! Enjoy the program!
